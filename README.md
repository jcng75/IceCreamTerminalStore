This project was done for a database management class as a final project.

The objective of this project was to make an interactive terminal ice cream store.  The program will allow you to add new customers, employees, and ice cream flavors.  On top of that, the program will also simulate restocking and purchasing of ice cream.  The sales of ice cream and amount bought by customers can be viewed as statistics.

To use this program, please do the following:
1. Clone/Copy the code
2. Install pgadmin4
3. Create a database with the name of your choice (Preferably "icecreamshop")
4. Modify the ```main.py``` file for the parameters dbname, user, and password
5. Run the following command ```python main.py```
